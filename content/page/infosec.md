Nick has more than 23 years of experience working as an information and physical security practitioner and executive in the public and private sectors. He has helped his clients safeguard some of the world’s most mission-critical systems.

From life-preserving cyber and physical security functions in the financial services, manufacturing, chemical, petroleum, and healthcare industries and in law enforcement, to critical cyber systems that protect billions of dollars of assets and cryptoassets in the financial services sector, we’ve made certain they stay secure, available, and that they work as intended. 

Nick currently provides information security, disaster- and cyber incident-readiness assessments at **[Fuzz Technology](https://fuzztechnology.com)**. His work is mainly pre-breach defense and post-breach incident response (and these days, he prefers the pre-breach stuff alot more). He currently serves as the interim Executive Director of the **[Cryptoasset & Blockchain ISAC](https://cryptoisac.org)**.

From 2021 to 2023, Nick served as VP of the Software Assurance Practice at Trail of Bits, and from 2019 to 2021 as Chief Security Officer at Paxos Trust Company. 

While serving as the **[NYPD](https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/index.page)** **[Intelligence Bureau](https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/bureaus/investigative/intelligence.page)**'s Director of Cyber Intelligence and Investigations, Nick helped the department understand how it investigates online, and how **[Cyber Enabled crime affects New Yorkers](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/15/796252827/coaxing-cops-to-tackle-cybercrime-theres-an-app-for-that)**. 

In 2005 he founded the information security practice at industry analyst firm 451 Research, where he served as 451’s Vice President, Research Operations until 2009.
