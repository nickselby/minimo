Twice Emmy-nominated (okay, okay, twice Emmy nominated as part of the team that did 'Live and Tape Sound Mixing and Sound Effects for a Drama Series' on a soap opera, but still, let's see your Emmy nomination, huh?) sound engineer, producer, and voice artist Nick Selby has what must be charitably called the weirdest career ever. He currently keeps his hand in as an engineer working on tape syncs and field recordings - learn more at **[tapesync.pro](https://tapesync.pro)** including a look at his enviable **[gear collection](https://tapesync.pro/gear)**. 

Nick was the voice, executive producer, and lead writer of the **[Trail of Bits Podcast](https://trailofbits.audio)** in 2022, and has been the co-host with **[Chris Swan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisswan/)** of the **[Tech Debt Burndown](https://techdebtburndown.com)** podcast since 2021. From 2017 to 2018, Nick was co-host with **[Peter Moskos](https://petermoskos.com)** of the **[Quality Policing Podcast](https://qualitypolicing.com)**, where in 2017 he reported, produced, voiced, and edited the long-form report, **[Divert to Where? Mental Health Policing in America](https://www.spreaker.com/user/qualitypolicing/qpp-12-divert-to-where-mental-health-pol)** 

{{< figure class="right" src="https://tapesync.pro/images/dmc_and_nick.png" caption="Darryl McDaniels and Nick ~1989"  >}}In the 1980s and '90s, Nick mixed live sound at venues from **[Lincoln Center](https://www.lincolncenter.org/)** to **[CBGB](https://www.cbgb.com/)**; worked in the studio as everything from a tracking engineer for Def Jam artists to a studio gofer. 

Nick co-owned from 1988 to 1991 a NYC recording studio with a 2-inch **[Ampex MM1000 16 track-recorder](https://reverb.com/item/1992923-classic-1970-s-ampex-mm1000-2-16-track-from-cbs-records-recapped-serviced-reliable)**, a 24-channel Sound Workshop Gold series console and a whole bunch of cool digital gear like, LOL, an **[AKAI S-1000](https://www.vintagesynth.com/akai/s1000.php)** with 32MB of RAM, and a bitchin'  MIDI-studio based around an **[Apple IIe computer](https://apple-history.com/aiie)**; and for three years sat in a 7-foot-by-7-foot booth working with a woman named Barbara who told him when to bring in the music and make it *louderlouderlouderlouder* on a CBS soap opera. 


In 1991 he worked as one of the first producers on Warsaw, Poland-based **[Radio Zet](https://www.radiozet.pl/)**, where he also was a sometime-morning drive-time DJ. He served as a creative director and production manager for an international ad agency before it fired him unceremoniously. Recently Nick has been working on a range of tape syncs and field production for podcasts, museums, and radio stations in the US and Europe.
